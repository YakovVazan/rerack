# Rerack

This project is like Wikipedia for audio plugs, making it easier for musicians and audio engeenirs to find the plug they are looking for among their already-owned-plugs.

This data base includes (or will include) all audio plugs for software like Pro Tools. Including image, name, type, company. Some future features are still under development.

Hoping to make this project beyond just owned plugs - we strive to make it an all-plugs-data-center.

For more ideas on how to expand this app, please feel free to contact me [here](https://github.com/YakovVazan).

For now, you can take it for a spin [here](https://rerack.netlify.com).

Note that due to using free hosting service for the API, the app goes to sleep every 15 mins. If it takes some time for it to upload, just be patient, it's on its way.

Peace.
